Below is a comprehensive set of **engineering requirements** to build a **Beatbox Looper MVP** with **5 channels**, along with a suggested **`progress.md`** structure for logging progress updates. I’ll list everything step-by-step, focusing on clarity, performance, and reliability. I will not include code, only the conceptual requirements and architecture.

## 1. Technical Overview

| Element            | Requirement                                                                                                                        |
|--------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Language**       | Python (Flask) for backend, plus HTML/CSS/JS in the frontend.                                                                       |
| **Frontend**       | HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Web Audio API, open-source waveform library (e.g., wavesurfer.js or something custom but “sexy”).           |
| **Backend**        | Simple Flask server serving static files and any additional endpoints needed (if trimming or processing is partially server-side). |
| **Data Storage**   | In-browser (memory or IndexedDB). No server-side storage.                                                                           |
| **Deployment**     | Local first, possibly Vercel eventually.                                                                                           |
| **Target Browser** | Modern browser (e.g., Chrome). No cross-browser requirement.                                                                        |
| **UI/UX**          | Black/orange/white color palette, grainy gradients, sharp corners, fluid waveforms, minimalistic yet visually “sexy.”              |
| **Performance**    | Response time under 10ms. No freezing, crashing, or audio glitches. Minimal CPU overhead.                                          |

## 2. Core Features & Flow

### 2.1 Recording & Audio Source
1. **Audio Input**:  
   - Must capture audio from any user-selected microphone (MacBook mic, Shure mic, etc.).  
   - Provide a user-friendly way to select an input device (if multiple are detected). This can be done using the standard browser permissions and device enumeration.

2. **Recording Behavior**:  
   - **Start Recording**: User clicks a “Record” button on a specific channel → the app starts capturing audio from the chosen mic device.  
   - **Stop Recording**: User stops the recording. The recorded track is stored in memory (Blob or ArrayBuffer).
   - **Playback**: Immediately after recording, the user can hit “Play” (or auto-play) to hear what they recorded.

3. **Waveform Visualization**:  
   - Must display a live waveform **while recording** (realtime display).  
   - Must store the waveform data to continue showing waveforms during trimming, playback, or idle.  

### 2.2 Channels
We have **5 channels** each with the same functionality.

1. **Channel Layout**  
   - A minimal card-like structure with:  
     - Title: “Channel 1”, “Channel 2”, etc.  
     - Waveform display for the currently loaded/recorded track.  
     - Volume slider.  
     - Record button to capture new audio from mic.  
     - “Scissor” icon for trimming.  
     - “Restart Track” button to replay from the beginning.  
     - FX drop-down or icons (echo, pitch shift, reverb, etc.).  
     - Delete track (trash icon) to remove the audio from that channel entirely.

2. **Volume Control**  
   - A slider from 0% to 100% volume.  
   - Applies volume changes in real-time.

3. **Delete / Reset**  
   - Clicking the trash icon resets the channel: removes audio data and resets the waveform display.

4. **Trimming**  
   - Clicking the “scissor” icon opens (or toggles) a small trimming UI with a timeline slider.  
   - The user can visually set in and out points on the waveform.  
   - The trimmed audio is then updated in that channel’s track.

5. **Restart Track**  
   - A button that restarts playback from the beginning of the track currently in that channel.

### 2.3 Audio Effects (FX)
We want multiple effects. Must have at least:
1. **Echo / Delay**  
   - Introduce a repeating echo after some milliseconds.

2. **Pitch Shift**  
   - Speeding up or slowing down playback without changing the track length, or using a more advanced pitch shifting approach.

3. **Reverb**  
   - Add a reverb effect for a sense of spatial depth.

4. **(Optional) Other Effects**  
   - Distortion (for a crunchy effect).  
   - Filter (low-pass, high-pass).  
   - Chorus / Flanger.  
   - These are optional but we should design the code such that new effects can be easily plugged in.

### 2.4 Global Recording
- A **global Record button** to record the “master mix” of everything playing across all channels.  
- Once the user presses “Stop,” that recorded mix is also stored in memory and can be looped.  
- Provide an option to loop the final mix seamlessly (with no audio gap or click between loop transitions).

### 2.5 Performance Criteria
- **No Hanging, Freezing, or Crashing**: Must handle real-time audio well.  
- **No Audio Glitches**: Must ensure low-latency buffering.  
- **Response Time**: Under 10ms for actions like play, stop, etc.

## 3. Detailed Engineering Requirements

### 3.1 Frontend Architecture
1. **HTML Structure**  
   - A main page with 5 channel sections plus a “global record” section.  
   - Channels can be horizontally or vertically laid out. Each channel has the same sub-elements (waveform, volume slider, etc.).  

2. **JavaScript Modules**  
   - `audioEngine.js`: Manages Web Audio contexts, effect processing, and track playback.  
   - `waveformUI.js`: Responsible for waveform display, either using a library (e.g., wavesurfer.js) or custom canvas.  
   - `main.js`: Manages the high-level UI logic, channel creation, event listeners for record/stop/play, plus global record logic.

3. **Waveform Visualization**  
   - Must show real-time waveforms during recording.  
   - Must show the final waveform for playback and trimming.  
   - Use a library or custom logic with `AnalyserNode` in Web Audio API to render wave data onto a Canvas element for that “sexy” vibe.  
   - Possibly use a gradient fill for the waveform in black/orange or a black background with orange waveform lines.

4. **CSS**  
   - Color scheme: black/orange/white + grainy gradients.  
   - Sharp corners for sections but maybe fluid wave animations for the waveform.  
   - Animated borders that react to sound amplitude (like a neon glow that intensifies with volume).  
   - Must remain visually responsive (scalable to different window sizes).

### 3.2 Recording Logic
1. **Device Selection**  
   - Use `navigator.mediaDevices.enumerateDevices()` to list all input devices.  
   - Let user pick which mic to use.  

2. **Audio Context**  
   - Each channel uses a separate `MediaStream` track or we manage all channels under one AudioContext but route signals to separate tracks.  
   - Must ensure no conflicts or heavy overhead.

3. **Stopping & Saving**  
   - Once the user stops recording, the raw data is converted into a format we can store in memory (e.g., WAV blob, or simpler if we just do in-memory arrays).  

4. **Playback**  
   - Each channel can be triggered to play independently or in sync with other channels.

### 3.3 Effects Implementation
1. **Inserting Effects**  
   - For each channel, chain an effect node in the Web Audio routing graph.  
   - Example for echo: `source -> delayNode -> gainNode -> channelMergerNode -> ... -> destination`.  
   - Provide user controls (slider knobs) for adjusting effect parameters (e.g., delay time, pitch shift ratio, reverb wet/dry).  

2. **Stacking Effects**  
   - Possibly allow multiple effects in sequence.  
   - Keep the CPU usage in mind. We want real-time performance with minimal overhead.  

### 3.4 Trimming
1. **Timeline Slider**  
   - The user drags the left and right handles on a timeline to define start and end.  
   - On “apply,” we do an in-memory slice of the audio buffer.  
   - Update the waveform to reflect only the trimmed portion.  

2. **Visual Feedback**  
   - Show the portion that will be cut out in a darker/lighter shade.  
   - Possibly show numeric timestamps or durations for precision.

### 3.5 Global Recording
1. **Mixdown**  
   - We create a separate `MediaStreamDestination` that all channels feed into.  
   - Pressing the “Record Master” button starts capturing the mix from that `MediaStreamDestination`.  

2. **Stopping**  
   - Convert the recorded data to a playable track.  
   - Display a final track waveform for the global recorded audio.  

3. **Looping**  
   - A “Loop” toggle that restarts playback at the end, seamlessly.  
   - Ensure no latency glitch at loop boundaries.

### 3.6 Performance & QA
1. **Latency**  
   - Keep buffers small but not too small (avoid pops or cracks).  
2. **Threading**  
   - The browser handles audio on a separate audio thread, but watch for heavy JS computations that could block the main thread.  
3. **Load Testing**  
   - Try short and long recordings.  
   - Test with multiple parallel recordings.  
4. **UI Responsiveness**  
   - Animations must remain smooth even while recording or playback is ongoing.

   - A global record button can capture the combined output of all channels, store it, and loop it.

2. **Performance**  
   - Under 10ms response time for user actions (e.g., play, stop, apply effect).  
   - No freezing, crashing, or CPU overload.  
   - No audio glitches or stutters when playing, trimming, or applying effects.

3. **UI/UX**  
   - Smooth, fluid, organic waveforms. Crisp color palette: black, orange, white. Sharp corners, grainy gradients. Engaging fonts. Animated borders reacting to sound amplitude.

4. **No Permanent Storage**  
   - Everything in-browser only. On refresh, everything resets.
